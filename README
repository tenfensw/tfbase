tfbase is a portable C99 library providing some of the functionality that vanilla C doesn't have, like lists & string ops among other things.

The library is licensed under Zero-clause BSD license and, hence, can be used in any commercial or personal project without any obligations or warranty.

On UNIX platforms, you can build libtfbase.a using the provided Makefile:

$ make

On Macs you can use the provided tfbase.xcodeproj to build the library with Xcode 3.1+. It is also possible to build it with make and it is even possible to target an older version from macOS with make:

$ make MACOSX_VERSION_MIN=10.5

The debug version can be compiled with the DEBUG flag enabled:

$ make DEBUG=1

The library is still WIP and has no fixed release cycle.

As for the docs, consult tfbase.h (the ONLY public header in the library) for usage info.
